* This backpack is meant to be soldered onto the J3 header, a VGA header.
--> very lightly coat the pads with solder paste or solder, then use a hot air gun to solder.
--> a 12 pin FFC cable plugs into the combo PCB's VGA header.
--> WARNING: you MUST use the same-side-up facing FFC cable, or you can short the VGA.
