* This backpack is meant to be soldered onto the J15 header, a dual-USB header.
--> very lightly coat the pads with solder paste or solder, then use a hot air gun to solder.
--> a 12 pin FFC cable plugs into the combo PCB's USB header.
--> WARNING: you MUST use the same-side-up facing FFC cable, or you can short the USB.

* Note that F1 and F3 next to the J15 header are unpopulated. USB will not work without these.
--> you should solder 1 to 1.5A polyfuses; size, SMD 1210, 3.2mm x 2.5mm.
